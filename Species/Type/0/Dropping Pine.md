Species of pine. Its xylem contains [[General/Chemistry/Groups/Ortia#Vivortium|Vivortium]], which turns some of the #energy/chemical of the tree into #energy/gravitational decreasing the amount of gravity that is applied to it, allowing the tree to grow taller. When a part of the tree breaks off, it is possible for it to keep floating up until it has no energy left and dies. It then falls quickly because of its mass, hence the name. When an entire tree of this species dies, it falls and crumbles under its own weight.

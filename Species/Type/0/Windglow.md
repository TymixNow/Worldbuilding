Species of thrift.
Contains [[General/Chemistry/Groups/Luxials#Luxium|Luxium]], which converts kinetic energy into light.
This flower thrives in the windy, moist conditions of oceanic climates by harnessing the kinetic energy of the wind.
As the wind blows, the petals of the flower capture this energy and emit a soft glow.
This bioluminescence not only attracts pollinators during the low-light conditions often present in these climates but also helps in seed dispersion by attracting nocturnal animals that aid in the process.

# Kinetic Energy Conversion:
Utilizes Luxium to convert wind energy into light, creating a bioluminescent effect.
# Pollinator Attraction:
The emitted light attracts pollinators in low-light conditions typical of oceanic climates.
# Seed Dispersion:
Nocturnal animals are drawn to the glowing flowers, aiding in seed dispersion.

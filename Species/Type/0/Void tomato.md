Species of food crop in a Mediterranean climate: Contains [[General/Chemistry/Groups/Tenebrials#Tenebrium|Tenebrium]], which converts light energy into thermal energy. 
This crop thrives in the hot, sunny conditions of Mediterranean climates by absorbing sunlight and converting it into heat, which is stored in its roots and leaves.
This thermal energy is gradually released during cooler nights, protecting the plant from temperature drops and enabling consistent growth.
Additionally, the warmth can accelerate the ripening process of its edible parts, ensuring a reliable and faster yield.
# Light to Thermal Energy Conversion:
Uses Tenebrium to convert sunlight into thermal energy, which is stored in the plant.
# Temperature Regulation:
Gradually releases stored heat during cooler nights, protecting the plant and ensuring steady growth.
# Enhanced Ripening:
The thermal energy speeds up the ripening process, providing a quicker and more reliable food source.

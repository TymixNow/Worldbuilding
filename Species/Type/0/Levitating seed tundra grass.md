Species of tundra grass: Contains [[General/Chemistry/Groups/Ortia#Thermortium|Thermortium]], which allows it to convert thermal energy into levitation.
This unique ability helps the grass thrive in the harsh tundra environment by lifting its seeds above the cold ground during the warmer periods of the day, aiding in dispersal by wind.
When the temperature drops, the seeds gently settle back to the ground, where they can germinate.
The grass itself can also partially levitate, reducing the stress from permafrost and helping to avoid damage during brief thaws.
# Seed Dispersal:
Seeds levitate during warm periods, aiding in wind dispersal.
# Plant Protection:
Grass partially levitates to avoid permafrost stress and damage during thaws.
# Thermal Energy Use:
Converts the limited thermal energy available in the tundra to create buoyancy and assist in survival and reproduction.

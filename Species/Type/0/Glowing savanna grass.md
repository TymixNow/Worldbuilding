Species of savanna grass: 
Contains [[General/Chemistry/Groups/Luxials#Lumenium|Lumenium]], which acts as a capacitor for light energy. 
This grass has adapted to the bright, sunlit conditions of the savanna by storing excess light energy during the day and releasing it at night.
This capability allows it to continue photosynthesis even after sunset, giving it a significant growth advantage over other plants that rely solely on daylight. 
Additionally, the light emitted during the night deters nocturnal herbivores, providing a protective mechanism.
# Light Energy Storage:
 Stores excess light energy during the day using Lumenium.
# Nighttime Photosynthesis:
Releases stored light energy at night to continue photosynthesis, enhancing growth.
# Herbivore Deterrence:
Emitted light at night deters nocturnal herbivores, protecting the plant.

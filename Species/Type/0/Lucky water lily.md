**Species of water lily in a swamp climate**: Contains [[General/Chemistry/Groups/Felicials#Solfelicium|Solfelicium]], which converts light energy into luck. This water lily thrives in the murky, dimly lit conditions of swamp environments by harnessing the available light and converting it into increased probabilities of beneficial events. This luck manifests in various ways, such as higher rates of successful pollination, greater resilience to diseases, and improved seed germination rates. The plant's ability to attract pollinators and its overall robustness make it a dominant species in its habitat.

- **Light to Luck Conversion**: Utilizes Solfelicium to convert light energy into luck, enhancing its chances of thriving.
- **Improved Pollination**: Increased probability of successful pollination attracts more pollinators.
- **Disease Resilience**: Greater resistance to common diseases found in swamp environments.
- **Enhanced Seed Germination**: Higher rates of seed germination ensure robust propagation.

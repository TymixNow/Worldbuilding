A species of wood-decomposing mould, that grows underground, in an appx. 25 cm thick brain-like structure
Lives in the #climates/rainforest 
# Parasite phase
Grows a line from the ground to the canopy, then slowly builds up a net of hyphae, blocking the leaves' access to sunlight.
# Connection phase
Once it gets enough sunlight, it sends a chemical signal and glucose created by a process equivalent to photosynthesis, possible due to [[General/Chemistry/Groups/Tenebrials#Herbium]] to the net growing in the ground beneath the tree. 
# Decay phase
The signal makes the fungus start taking water away from the tree, and start decomposing the tree. 
# Continuation
After the tree decomposes, the mould moves on to its next victim. The current line and net keep feeding off of the tree until it collapses and become a part of the ground

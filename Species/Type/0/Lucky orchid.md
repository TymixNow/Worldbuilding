Species of Orchid in a Rainforest Climate: Contains [[General/Chemistry/Groups/Felicials#Amuletium|Amuletium]], which converts chemical energy into luck. This orchid thrives in the dense, competitive environment of the rainforest by harnessing Amuletium to increase its chances of survival and reproduction. The luck generated from chemical energy improves pollination success, enhances resistance to diseases and pests, and boosts seed germination rates. The orchid's flowers, benefiting from this luck, attract a diverse array of pollinators, ensuring genetic diversity and resilience.

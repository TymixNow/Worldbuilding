Species of squirrel. Adapted to living in the tundra climate, it builds nests in the upper branches of the [[../0/Dropping Pine|Dropping Pine]]. It feeds on the tree's Vivortium-rich pine cones, which provide essential energy. When branches break off and float, the squirrel uses them as transportation to new areas. This relationship allows the squirrel to avoid predators and aids the pine in seed dispersal. Has patagia (flying squirrel wings).
